# **Modules**
Modules in Leadmin are features that can be disabled by choice.

## Files
With the files module you will be able to manage files and share them with other students and teachers.
It also has an option for "dropping" files. Users with the permission can create "drops" where specific classes/students/users with the link can upload the files directly to a place where the User can manage them in one place.

## Bulletin
Bulletin will be a module for providing announcements, replacement plans (if a lesson is canceled or replaced for the day) and general timetables for the students and teachers.
